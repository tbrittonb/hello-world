# hello-world
this repository is to be use for the South Carolina Knitting Guild website
i volunteered to help SCKG redo their website.
I decided to use Wordpress, because i needed all the help i could get.
i have a lot of it done,, just trying to do some things they must have on their memberships page
i.e. expiration date for memberships and into 6 months of the year, offer 50% off.  so that is what i am trying to figure out.
